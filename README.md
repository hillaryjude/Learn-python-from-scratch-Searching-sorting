# Searching Algorithms

## Table of Contents
1. [Linear Search](#linear-search): A simple search algorithm that checks every element in a list until the desired element is found or the list ends.
2. [Binary Search](#binary-search): A more efficient search algorithm that works on sorted lists by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.
3. [Recursive Binary Search](#recursive-binary-search): A variant of binary search that uses recursion to divide the search interval.
4. [Square Root of a Number](#square-root-of-a-number): This algorithm calculates the square root of a number using a method such as the Newton-Raphson method.
